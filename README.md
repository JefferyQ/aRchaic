```

To load the package in R

```
library(aRchaic)
```

## Methods

We propose a model based approach to cluster ancient (UG/non UDG) and modern samples based on known DNA damage patterns like type of mismatch, the strand breaks and position of mismatch on the read. Our model is based on a fast and more efficient version of the Grade of Membership model and we present a novel way to interpret and visualize the clusters. Additionally we also provide functions to visualize DNA damage patterns for a single BAM file, methods to classify each read in the BAM file as modern or ancient, along with model based classification techniques for moderns and ancient samples.
