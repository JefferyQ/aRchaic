\title{STRUCTURE plot and logo plot representation of the clusterring
model from archaic_fit}
\usage{
archaic_plot(model, topic_cols = c("red", "blue", "darkgoldenrod1", "cyan",
  "firebrick", "green", "hotpink", "burlywood", "yellow", "darkgray",
  "deepskyblue", "darkkhaki", "brown4", "darkorchid", "magenta", "yellow",
  "azure1", "azure4"), background = "modern", structure.control = list(),
  logo.control = list(), output_dir = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Fitted model from \code{archaic_fit}.}

\item{max_pos}{The maximum position from the ends of the reads for which
mismatches are considered in aRchaic.}

\item{output_rda}{If non-NULL, the processed data for each
directory in \code{dirs} is saved as a .Rdata file.}
}
\value{
Returns a matrix with rows being the samples (each MFF file),
columns representing the mismatch signatures (comprising of features like
mismatch type, flanking bases and strand break information).
The cells contain counts of the number of mutational signatures observed in
that MFF file.
}
\description{
Takes the clustering model fit  from \code{archaic_fit}
as an input and plots the clusters using as EDLogo plots (Dey et al 2018)
and the proportional mixing of the clusters for each sample using a
STRUCTURE plot (Pritchard et al 2000) representation.
